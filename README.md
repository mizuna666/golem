# Golem For Social Good 

Challenge in learning AI is always the computing power. Machine learning and deep learning requires computing power, with just one device, the computing power may not be enough. To solve this problem, some will use cloud computing, but the cost is way too expensive for anyone trying to access this knowledge. Not everyone could have the resource to use free or sponsored computing power. Some are even self learning, or have some reasons not qualified to use academic resources to do their research.

# What if we could borrow computing powers?

With golem, at this point though only with CPU computing, with many devices supporting, everyone could easily learn AI, without any boundary. In the future golem could consider supporting devices to share GPU computing powers.

Most AI talents are educated in wealthy countries, not surprising to know that the reason could be the high cost of computing power. But now, with borrowing and lending the computing power of our devices, it may benefit those who cannot afford to do AI researchers. And could inspire more people with enthusiasm with a low cost to join in learning AI.

# Sharing computing power for education for ALL in the world

By sharing the computing power, golem could reward those with tokens(could be GNT or a new token), while the borrowers must use tokens to use the computing powers. 

# Below is how token works:
